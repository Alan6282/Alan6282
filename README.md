Hi 👋, I'm Alan S Mathew  
Backend Developer | Python & Node.js

I'm a backend-focused developer who enjoys building clean, scalable, and well-structured server-side applications.  
My primary experience is with **Python and Django (DRF)**, and I also work with **Node.js and Express** for backend APIs.

I like working close to the data layer — designing APIs, handling authentication, improving performance, and keeping systems maintainable.  
Always learning, always building.
